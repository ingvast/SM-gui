# User interface
## Settings
* In settings make it possible to choose keyboard shortcuts. modifier and key.
* In Settings make it possible to select base size of text. Scale all text relative to that.

## State properties
* In state properties the transitions can be reorderd with arrows. Remove those and make them draggable. See reordering of states in state tree.

## Drawing canvas
* For compound states, the display of the enty/exit/do code, if exist and show checkboxes are checked, should be displayed in a specific box, that does not look like the state box.
  Instead I can think it should have double lines to stand out.  The informmation should be displayed with the same rules as in states now.


# General

# Watch mode
* Should be possible to go to watch mode meaning nothing can be edited, only looked upon.
* Possible to subscribe to a topic that publishes current state
* Every state active should light up
